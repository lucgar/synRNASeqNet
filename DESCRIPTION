Description: This package implements various estimators of mutual information, such
	as the maximum likelihood and the Millow-Madow estimator, various Bayesian estimators,
	the shrinkage estimator, and the Chao-Shen estimator. It also offers wrappers
	to the kNN and kernel density estimators.
	Furthermore, it provides various index of performance evaluation such as
	precision, recall, FPR, F-Score, ROC-PR Curves and so on.
	Lastly, it provides a brand new way of generatic synthetic RNA-Seq Network with know
	dependence structure.
