Version: 1.0
Date: 2015-04-07
Author: Luciano Garofano, Stefano Maria Pagnotta, Michele Ceccarelli
Maintainer: Luciano Garofano <lucianogarofano88@gmail.com>
Depends: R (>= 3.1.1), parallel, parmigene, GenKern, igraph
URL: https://github.com/lucgar/synRNASeqNet
Imports: KernSmooth
Description: It implements various estimators of mutual information, such as
	the maximum likelihood and the Millow-Madow estimator, various Bayesian
	estimators, the shrinkage estimator, and the Chao-Shen estimator. It also
	offers wrappers to the kNN and kernel density estimators. Furthermore, it
	provides various index of performance evaluation such as precision, recall,
	FPR, F-Score, ROC-PR Curves and so on. Lastly, it provides a brand new way
	of generating synthetic RNA-Seq Network with known dependence structure.
